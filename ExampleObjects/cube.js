 a second example object for graphics town
 check out "simplest" first

 the cube is more complicated since it is designed to allow making many cubes

 we make a constructor function that will make instances of cubes - each one gets
 added to the grobjects list

 we need to be a little bit careful to distinguish between different kinds of initialization
 1) there are the things that can be initialized when the function is first defined
    (load time)
 2) there are things that are defined to be shared by all cubes - these need to be defined
    by the first init (assuming that we require opengl to be ready)
 3) there are things that are to be defined for each cube instance
