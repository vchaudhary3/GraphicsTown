# GraphicsTownJS
GraphicsTown in JavaScript - basic framework code for CS559 

# Usage
Javascript, HTML and OpenGL.

# Description
This project's main objective was to create a graphic environment. There are some objects that are always in motion, almost all objects  are textured and shaded. The user can also travel through the virtual environment, controlled by moving the perspective camera. 

# Reference
For this project I referred heavily to frameworks built by Michael Gliecher for CS 559 (2015) and others.
