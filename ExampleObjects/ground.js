/**
 this is even simpler than the simplest object - it's a ground plane underneath
 the objects (at Z=0) - just a big plane. all coloring handled in the vertex
 shader. no normals. it's just a checkerboard that is simple.

 no normals, but a funky shader

 however, I am going to do it with TWGL to keep the code size down
